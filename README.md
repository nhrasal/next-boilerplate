### Philosophy

- Minimal code
- SEO-friendly
- 🚀 Production-ready
### Requirements

- Node.js 14+ and npm

### Getting started

Then, you can run locally in development mode with live reload:

```shell
npm run dev
```
### Testing

All tests are colocated with the source code inside the same directory. So, it makes it easier to find them. Unfortunately, it is not possible with the `pages` folder which is used by Next.js for routing. So, what is why we have a `pages.test` folder to write tests from files located in `pages` folder.
